## Here's what I did:-
- Cleaned the raw dataset
- Used the XLOOKUP and other basic Excel formulas to enrich the data
- Created pivot tables for analysis
- Curated an interactive dashboard to visualise this data.

## Tools used:-
- MS Excel

## More about the dashboard:-
- The dashboard is interactive and follows a coffee-based colour theme, making it extremly visually appealing.
- The dashboard includes Timelines and Slicers for customised visualization.
- The dashboard displays the **Sales overtime using a line chart, Sales by quarter using a bar chart and Country-wise sales using a pie chart**.
